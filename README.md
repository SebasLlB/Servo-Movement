# Servo-Movement
As I progressed in programming, I came into interest with the field of mechatronics.
It is a passion of mine to build things from scratch, just like the Legos I used to 
build as a kid.

Thus, I started getting more mechanical components, and among these are the most
fundamental to me: Servos.

With these Servos I was able to create my big major project: a mechanical claw made
from cardboard, glue, and nails. Getting all the components working gave me the opportunity
to complete many tests to understand just how precise Servos can be when used well.
